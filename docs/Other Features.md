## Transaction Fees

The transfer of currency tokens, bond tokens, and seigniorage share tokens on the Decentral Bank Network can be paid in fees denominated in the token or by staking share tokens similar to standard EOSIO software. Fees can be modified to adjust incentives to better match the network's needs.

## Private Transactions

The Decentral Bank UTXO token is a fungible token which allows for Bitcoin-like pseudo-anonymity. It would be possible to integrate distributed ledger privacy features such as zero knowledge proofs which would allow for any user to exchange UTXO currency tokens without revealing their identity similar to zCash and Monero networks.
