## Seigniorage Shares (Symbol: DSS)

The seigniorage shares contract prints new share tokens and auctions them for currency in a reverse Dutch auction every R time period. The name of the contract is a homage to Robert Sams' stablecoin mechanism system of the same name since share tokens function similarly here and represent "equity in the network and entitle holder to future profit/seigniorage."

All share tokens are fungible with one another. The more equity tokens that are printed and auctioned for currency, the greater the retraction of the currency. Share tokens are used to vote for block producers as well as allocate the transaction fees of the network. They also have a right to printed currency tokens as the network expands. The share token is also the SYS token of the EOSIO software.
