## Reserve
The collateralized token reserve allows for the issued currency tokens to be backed by cryptographic assets across multiple chains. The reserve is controlled by multi-signature authorization of network consensus nodes/block producers. When new currency is printed by the network and not needed to pay bond holders, seigniorage share holders, and other users, it is placed in the reserve to auction off for various crypto assets. The types of assets held in the reserve, and their proportion, are decided by network consensus nodes/block producers.  

### Basket Reserve
Basketing multiple crypto assets across multiple chains is important to keep volatility low in assets held. The network's basket smart contract allows conesnsus nodes/block producers to set basket ratios and targets for the crypto assets held in the reserve.

### Depository Reserve
Users can make time-restricted deposits into the network, through which they can accrue transaction fees collected over a set number of block periods. Transaction fees are distributed to depositors pro-rata.
